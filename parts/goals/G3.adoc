TIP: _New processes, or improvement to existing processes, made possible by the project's results. It presents the business benefits expected from the successful execution of the project. **This chapter is the core of the Goals book**, describing what the organization expects from the system. It ensures that the project remains focused: if at some stage it gets pushed in different directions, with "creeping featurism" threatening its integrity, a reminder about the original business goals stated in those chapters will help._  <<BM22>>

==== Overview
The Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered manuscript fragment reconstruction platform for Buddhist Studies scholars addresses a challenge in digital humanities by transforming an overwhelming manual process into a scalable, collaborative, AI-enhanced workflow.

==== Primary Business Benefits

==== 1. Dramatic Scale Increase in Reconstruction Capability
* **Current limitation**: Manual reconstruction is extremely time-consuming and tedious
* **Expected benefit**: AI-assisted matching will enable processing of hundreds to thousands of fragments systematically
* **Impact**: Unlocks the potential to meaningfully progress through the 21,000+ fragments possessed by the british library as well as other institutions

==== 2. Acceleration of Scholarly Research
* **Time savings**: Reduce fragment matching from hours/days per potential match to minutes through AI-powered suggestions
* **Quality improvement**: Multiple AI-generated hypotheses allow scholars to evaluate more possibilities than humanly feasible
* **Research velocity**: Enable completion of reconstruction projects within significantly shorter timelines

==== 3. Methodological Innovation in Digital Humanities
* **Technical advancement**: Pioneer AI applications for irregular archaeological artifact reconstruction
* **Reproducible research**: Establish systematic methodologies for similar reconstruction challenges in other domains
* **Research infrastructure**: Create reusable computational tools for manuscript studies globally

==== Strategic Value Proposition

The platform represents a shift from individual scholarly craft to collaborative, AI-augmented research infrastructure. This transformation enables:

* **Scalability**: Moving from individual fragment analysis to systematic processing of entire collections
* **Sustainability**: Creating methodology that can be maintained and improved over time
* **Innovation**: Developing computational approaches that extend human expertise rather than replacing it
