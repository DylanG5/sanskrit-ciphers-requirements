=== (P.7) Requirements process and report

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Initially, description of what the requirements process will be; later, report on its steps. It starts out as a plan for conducting the requirements elicitation process, but is meant to be updated as part of that process so that it includes the key lessons of elicitation._  <<BM22>>

==== Planned Process
* We plan on using a couple of methods in order to elicit our requirements.
** Semi-structured interviews (primary): 4–5 researchers, 20–30 minutes each, in-person or video call. Focused on pain points, workflows, and domain challenges.
** Online survey (secondary): 25–30 academic community members. Short questionnaire to validate findings quantitatively.
** Observational study (supplementary): 3–4 researchers observed for 1–2 hours to identify implicit behaviours and actual practices.
** Structured interviews (excluded): Not chosen due to insufficient domain knowledge for effective closed questions.

==== Target User Groups
* Primary users
** Buddhist studies professors and researchers.
** Digital humanities scholars.
** Manuscript specialists and palaeographers.
* Secondary users
** Graduate students working with ancient manuscripts and reconstruction tasks.

==== Objectives
* Understand current manual workflows and pain points in fragment reconstruction.
* Identify functional needs for automated detection, matching, and transcription support.
* Capture usability and workflow-integration requirements for academic research settings.
* Establish expectations for accuracy, performance, and collaboration/sharing features.

==== Instruments & Protocols
* Interview guide
** Recent tool usage (what/why/learning curve), challenges, desired features.
** End-to-end walkthrough of receiving and processing a new fragment set.
** Tracking/organization practices; progress management; collaboration needs.
* Survey
** Short, closed-ended items to validate priority features and pain points at scale.
* Observation
** Note actual vs. reported behaviours; tools used; environment constraints; implicit steps.
* Recording & consent
** Obtain consent for audio recording during interviews; anonymize notes for analysis.

==== Reporting and Updates

This section will be updated iteratively as elicitation is carried out:  

* After interviews: Summarize recurring themes (pain points, desired features, implicit needs).  
* After survey analysis: Report statistical validation of key requirements.  
* After observational studies: Note discrepancies between reported and actual workflows.  

The evolving results will be documented in the SRS, ensuring traceability between user needs and formal requirements.
