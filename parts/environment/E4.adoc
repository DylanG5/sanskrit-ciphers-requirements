TIP: _Properties of the environment that may be assumed, with the goal of facilitating the project and simplifying the system.

The environment is assumed to have properties that will influence the design and implementation of the system.

*User Expertise*: The users of the system will have a basic understanding of Buddhist studies and familiarity with digital tools for text analysis. This assumption allows the system to be designed with a focus on advanced features without needing to provide extensive tutorials or guidance for basic usage.

*Dataset Availability*: The number of high-quality text fragments available for the system is large enough for classification. The system's functionality depends on this assumption, as it trains the model on a dataset of text fragments. Although it is a subset of all existing fragments, this data set is expected to represent all fragments properly so that the model will be able to process new fragments effectively. 

*Technological Infrastructure*: The users will have access to modern computing devices and reliable internet connections. This assumption enables the system to implement advanced computational resources without being constrained by the limitations of users' hardware.
