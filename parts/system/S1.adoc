The system consists of three main clusters that work together to enable scholars to reconstruct ancient Buddhist manuscript fragments through computational analysis and interactive manipulation.

==== Front-end Cluster

* *User Authentication Interface*: Login and session management components for secure user access.
* *Fragment Upload Interface*: Components for uploading manuscript fragment images with support for batch uploads and image format validation.
* *Interactive Canvas Module*: A drag-and-drop workspace where users can display, move, rotate, zoom, and inspect one or multiple fragment images simultaneously.
* *Match Discovery Module*: Interface for triggering AI model analysis and viewing match suggestions for selected fragments.
* *Progress Management Module*: Tools for saving and loading user study sessions, including fragment arrangements, annotations, and match evaluations.

==== Backend Cluster

* *API Gateway*: RESTful API endpoints for handling frontend requests and coordinating backend operations.
* *Authentication Service*: User authentication, authorization, and session management.
* *Image Processing Service*: Preprocessing pipeline for fragment normalization, orientation correction, and format standardization.
* *Database Access Layer*: Service layer managing interactions with all database systems.
* *Match Orchestration Service*: Coordinates requests to AI/ML models and aggregates results into ranked match suggestions.

===== Data Storage Cluster

* *Fragment Image Database*: Stores high-resolution fragment images, preprocessed versions, and image metadata (resolution, format, upload date).
* *User Database*: Maintains user accounts, authentication credentials, preferences, and access permissions.
* *Project Database*: Tracks reconstruction projects, fragment arrangements, match history, confidence scores, user progress states, and study session snapshots.

==== AI/ML Cluster

* *Edge Pattern Matching Model*: Analyzes fragment edge shapes and contours to identify physical matches where fragments may have been torn or broken from the same page. Generates edge signature vectors for comparison.
* *Handwriting Style Classifier*: Analyzes script characteristics, writing style, and paleographic features to group fragments by scribe or writing period. Outputs style vectors for similarity comparison.
* *Damage Pattern Recognition Model*: Identifies and characterizes damage signatures including tears, stains, creases, and deterioration patterns. Creates damage pattern fingerprints that indicate fragments exposed to similar conditions.
* *Text Extraction Model*: Extracts Sanskrit text from fragment images, handling various script styles and deterioration levels. Outputs transcribed text and character-level confidence scores.
* *Content Similarity Model*: Performs semantic analysis on extracted text to identify thematic and linguistic connections between fragments. Generates content embeddings for matching.
