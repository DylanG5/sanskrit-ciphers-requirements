=== (S.5) Prioritization

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Classification of the behaviors, interfaces and scenarios (<<s2>>, <<s3>> and <<s4>>) by their degree of criticality. It is useful in particular if during the course of the project various pressures force the team to drop certain functions._  <<BM22>>

==== Critical (Must-Have)
* Secure login and authentication (S.4.1) 
** required for system access and user management.
* Fragment upload, orientation, and normalization (S.4.2) 
** enables the core workflow of preparing digitized manuscripts.
* Fragment matching and reconstruction (S.4.3) 
** essential for achieving the projectâ€™s scholarly goals.
* Script identification (S.4.4) 
** foundational to understanding and categorizing fragments.
* Database search and exploration (S.4.6) 
** critical for enabling scholars to retrieve and compare fragments efficiently.

==== Important (Should-Have)
* Transcription assistance (S.4.5) 
** significantly enhances usability and research speed, but manual transcription remains possible if OCR fails.
* Match sensitivity tuning and side-by-side comparison (alternate flow of S.4.3) 
** improves researcher control and reliability of results.
* Manual overrides for classification and orientation 
** ensures system flexibility where automation falls short.
* Exporting search results and transcriptions 
** supports collaboration and documentation.

==== Optional (Nice-to-Have)
* Session management (save, load, version history) 
** valuable for long-term projects but not mandatory for demonstrating proof-of-concept.
* Annotation features on fragments  
** enhances usability but not required for minimal viable system.
* Integration with external segmentation tools 
** useful for advanced workflows but not critical for initial delivery.
* Read-only sharing links 
** convenient for collaboration but not essential for project success.
